A jQuery plugin that allows you set an interval timer with hooks to interrupt 
the timer and wait before resuming the interval.

Example:
Isn't it annoying when there's an image slider/carousel on a web page that
insists on automatically cycling away from the image you've selected because of
some interval timer that has been set?  Wouldn't it be nicer if the slider
waited for a period of user inactivity before resuming its automatic cycling?
The interruptibleInterval plugin makes setting up this kind of behaviour easy.
